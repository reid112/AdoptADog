# AdoptADog
24 hour hackathon project for CC Rez Q!


Problem Statement:
"Currently, most of CC RezQs communication with foster families is done via text message and data is tracked manually on paper. With ~60 dogs in care at any given time, this method can quickly become difficult to organize and maintain. CC RezQs is looking for a way to quickly access information about dogs in foster care, including: medical updates, medicine lists, injury reports, supply updates, pictures, training help, and more!"
